<h2>Using Libra</h2>
This document assumes that you have already <a href="install.html">built Libra</a> and installed it in a directory, <code>$PREFIX</code>.

<h3>Set up your PATH</h3>
You will need to set up your paths as follows (this is for bourne shell; adjust appropriately for csh):
<pre class="code">
# All systems
export PATH="${PREFIX}/bin:$PATH"
export PYTHONPATH="${PREFIX}/lib/python2.5/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH"

# Dynamic load path for UNIX systems
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${PREFIX}/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"

# Dynamic load path for Mac OS X
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="${PREFIX}/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH"
</pre>
Note that you only need to set <code>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> on Mac OS X.  Also note that if you are using Python 2.4, you will need to change the version number appropriately in <code>PYTHONPATH</code>.


<h3>Instrument your code</h3>
Libra requires that your code have some kind of <i>progress step</i>.  In most codes this corresponds to a timestep, but it's up to you what you set it to.  In general, this needs to be a globally synchronous event, or at least some event that will happen the <b>same</b> number of times on all processes by the end of a run.  
<p>
Instrument your code with <code>MPI_Pcontrol(0)</code> where the timestep occurs, for example:
<pre class="code">
for (int time=0; time < MAX_TIME; time++) {
    // solve stuff
    MPI_Pcontrol(0);    // end of timestep
}
</pre>

<h3>Running the Libra backend</h3>
Running Libra with dynamic libraries is a matter of preloading the Libra instrumentation library when you run an MPI application.  On most systems, this looks something like the following:
<pre class="code">
$ env LD_PRELOAD=${PREFIX}/lib/libpmpi-effort.so \
    mpirun -np $PROCS my_application
</pre>
For static executables, you will need to link your application against <code>libpmpi-effort.a</code> before you run.  Add the following libraries to your link line to accomplish this:
<pre class="code">
-L$(PREFIX)/lib -lpmpi-effort -leffort -lcallpath -lwavelet
-L$(SW_PREFIX)/lib -lstackwalk -lsymtabAPI -lcommon   # May omit -lsymtabAPI or -lcommon
-L$(PAPI_PREFIX)/lib -lpapi                           # If you need PAPI counters
-lrt                                                  # For Linux timers
-lstdc++                                              # For Fortran applications only
</pre>
Use your own prefixes for Stackwalker and PAPI above where they apply.  Then run your application as before:
<pre class="code">
$ mpirun -np $PROCS my_statically_linked_application
</pre>

If Libra runs correctly, the error output of your application should include something that looks like this:

   metrics            = time
   pass_limit         = 5
   scale              = 1024
   rows_per_process   = 512

Below the ASCII logo, there is a list of environment variables you can set to control the way Libra gathers data.  They can be tweaked by exporting custom values as follows:
<dl>
<dt>metrics</dt>
<dd>Comma-separated List of metrics to gather data for.  Standard PAPI metric names and 'time' are valid.</dd>

<dt>pass_limit</dt>
<dd>Controls compression level.  Default is 5.  Smaller yields higher compression but less accuracy.  Larger gives less compression but more accuracy.  Max is 64.</dd>

<dt>scale</dt>
<dd>Scaling factor for floating point numbers before quantization.  Use this if you are gathering floating-point valued metrics.  Coarsely controls precision of compressed data (e.g. if you want 3 decimal places preserved, use a scaling factor of 1000)</dd>

<dt>rows_per_process</dt>
<dd>Controls amount of aggregation of data done before compression and write-out.  Also affects number of concurrent writers.  Must be a power of 2.  Numbers between 32-512 seem to work well.  If compression seems slow on systems smaller than 512 nodes, try setting this lower.</dd>

<dt>chop_libc</dt>
<dd>Whether to chop libc routines off of stack traces.  If set to 1, will stop at main() in all stacktraces.</dd>

<dt>regions</dt>
<dd>Control what data is collected.  Three possible values:
<ul>
<li><b>effort</b>: Record time spent (and metrics consumed) in regions of code between certain MPI calls.  Measures computational load.
<li><b>comm</b>: Record time spent in certain MPI calls across all processes and timesteps.
<li><b>both</b>: Record both communication and computational load.
</ul>

</dd>

<dt>sampling</dt>
<dd>Sample timesteps.  <i>e.g.</i> if this is set to 10, will treat every 10 timesteps as one timestep.</dd>

</dl>

<h3>Build symbol database</h3>
Once your run is over, you should see a directory called <code>effort-N</code> in the directory where you ran your application, where N is the number of processes you ran with:
<pre class="code">
$ ls
my_application     data/     effort-512/
</pre>
Change to the effort directory like so:
<pre class="code">
$ cd effort-512
$ ls
effort-time-0-1     effort-time-0-5     effort-time-0-9     effort-time-0-13
effort-time-0-2     effort-time-0-6     effort-time-0-10    effort-time-0-14
effort-time-0-3     effort-time-0-7     effort-time-0-11    times
effort-time-0-4     effort-time-0-8     effort-time-0-12    
</pre>
There may be lots of effort files.  Before you can make sense of this data in the viewer, you need to build symbol data from it.  Run <code>libra-build-viewer-data</code> in this directory like so:
<pre class="code">
$ libra-build-viewer-data -e ../my_application -I /path/to/my_application/src
</pre>
Supply the path to your executable with the <code>-e</code> option, and supply the path to your application's source with code with -I.  You can supply multiple directories if need be, but -I processes subdirectories recursively, so this may not be necessary.
<p>

Once this is done, you should see a <code>viewer-data</code> directory alongside your effort files.  This contains symbol information about the Libra data files, as well as copies of source files to display in the GUI.

<h3>ef Tool</h3>
If you do not want to use the GUI viewer, you can inspect effort files using a tool called <b>ef</b>.  By default, <code>ef</code> prints metadata about effort files:
<pre class="code">
$ ef -f effot-time-0-1
Metric    time
Type      0
Start     null_callpath

The <code>-f</code> option tells <code>ef</code> to print out function data.  Run <code>ef -h</code> for a list of full options (including dumping raw data and formatting output in formats more usable by command-line tools).

<h3>Python interface</h3>
There are python classes that you can use to work with effort data.   These are not currently finalized or well-documented, but for more information, please email <a href="mailto:tgamblin_AT_llnl_gov">tgamblin at llnl.gov</a>.

<h3>Run GUI client</h3>
To view Libra data in the GUI frontend, tar up the <code>effort-N</code> directory on your cluster and copy it to a machine where you can run your front-end. If you built the Libra GUI on the cluster, you can skip this step.
<p>
<b>On cluster:</b>
<pre class="code">
$ tar cvzf effort-512.tar.gz effort-512
</pre>

<b>On client:</b>
<pre class="code">
$ scp cluster.myschool.edu:effort-512.tar.gz .
$ tar xzf effort-512.tar.gz
</pre>
Once you've moved the data where you want to view it, change to the effort directory and invoke libra:
<pre class="code">
$ cd effort-512
$ libra
</pre>
Documentation for the Libra GUI is forthcoming.  Please send feedback to  <a href="mailto:tgamblin_AT_llnl_gov">tgamblin at llnl.gov</a>!
